## Code Fix Prizes

I am offering some prizes for people who can fix some of the known bugs and missing features.  I have just started a new job and will have limited time for this project.  Rather than make you all wait on the code, I thought I'd share it as is and ask for a bit of help.

## Details:

I am giving away a few of my first batch of prototype PCBs.  They may have a couple of minor errors (I already found one
error due to incorrect pin mapping in an Eagle part).  They will be fully populated - valued at over $30 just for parts.
They feature full optical and electrical isolation, an ESP100 with 8M flash, and 3x WS2812 status LEDs.  Postage is included.

In order to receive one, please complete one of the following tasks.  You can "win" multiple boards.

1 - Fix the WDT reset issue (https://github.com/mtongnz/ESP8266_ArtNetNode_v2/issues/41)

2 - Implement stored scenes function.  I want it to allow for static scenes or for chases to run.

3 - Most bug fixes, code improvements, feature additions & helpful submissions.

    eg. Fixing the flickering WS2812 (https://github.com/mtongnz/ESP8266_ArtNetNode_v2/issues/36)
    
        Adding other pixel strips (https://github.com/mtongnz/ESP8266_ArtNetNode_v2/issues/42)
        
        Creating new web UI theme (https://github.com/mtongnz/ESP8266_ArtNetNode_v2/issues/22)

These prizes will be based on the first person to submit a solution that I judge to be adequate.  My decision is final.

As stated above, I am quite short on time so it might take a while for me to test any relevant fixes.

Thanks heaps for the support.
